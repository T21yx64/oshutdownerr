** oshutdownerr**

*A simple batch script & vbs no gui Utility that forces windows os shutdown after specified duration.*

If you want a Compact Gui, 

I'm a huge fan of Konrad Twardowski for creating Kshutdown freeware utility, available on most platforms

get from this link is.gd/kshutdown

or from source-forge directly..

**How it works?**

Make shortcut for beautification and quick easy trigger using shortcut key.

Edit simply specify hours, minutes, or both.. in time.. after which you want to schedule a shutdown.

it opens run, and natively executes the shutdown command by pasting it there.

** version timeline:-**

~~version 1: raw predifined paste of shutdown -s -t 00 onto run. & raw execution using clip and shell.~~

~~version 2.0: added vbs for simple autokey.~~

~~version 2.1: forced shutdown, fixed some minor bugs and cleaned up code.~~

~~version 2.2: fixed inputting errors.. cleaned up some code.~~

~~version 2.3: variables and choice for time adjustment. reduced variables, speed up execution. made code more readable~~

~~version 2.4: addedd double execution to remove rare latency or defocus error. often caused in windows 11~~

future version 3: Add more options for sleep and hibernate.
